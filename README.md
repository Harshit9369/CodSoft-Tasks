# CodSoft-Tasks
Contains the task files I completed during my internship at CodSoft. 

# SPAM-DETECTION:
I trained multiple models on this task and I found out that Support Vector Classifier provides the best Accuracy Score so I included 
that only in the file. 

# BANK-CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION
In this file, I have trained multiple models and I have tried my best to improve the Accuracy Score, Precision Score, Recall Score 
and F1-Score as much as possible.
